Crumb Catcher,2024.0,"drama, comedy, thriller","The subplots dangle, the suspense unravels, and the primary relationship never takes off. What you’re left with isn’t an arresting piece of filmmaking, but an idea that is stretched beyond the ability to naturally hold one’s attention without relying on loud filmmaking and even louder themes.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Widow Clicquot,2024.0,drama,"From its eureka moment when Barbe-Nicole develops her iconic rose champagne to its final title cards about the company’s ongoing success, Widow Clicquot has all the same beats as the walk-and-talk business movie that you watched on your last flight. It would make perfect in-carriage entertainment for a drowsy Victorian family taking a long trip across the countryside.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Great Absence,2024.0,drama,"Anyone who has dealt with the deterioration of a parent will find something resonant in Chika-ura’s film, one that can sometimes feel self-indulgent in its pacing and length but never loses its nuance, thanks both to its refined direction and a truly stellar performance from the legendary Tatsuya Fuji.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Crossing ,2024.0,drama,"Perhaps a bit predictably, Crossing emphasizes the importance of forging new connections rather than holding onto relationships that may no longer serve us. However, its dramatic conclusion still manages to forgo cliched expectations and cater instead to the limitless possibilities that abound in an urban sprawl.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Inside Out,2015.0,"animation, adventure, comedy, drama, family, fantasy","Co-directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen have told a very, very small-scale story when you look at what happens in the actual physical world. But in doing so, they've done something very powerful, because they have paid full respect to just how turbulent and important the inner life of a child can be.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Coco,2017.0,"animation, adventure, drama, family, fantasy, musical, mystery","The vividness of the narrative never quite matches the riotous swirl of color and culture on screen — and neither do the songs, sadly, for how central they are to the story. Instead, Coco settles into something gentler but still irrefutably sweet: a movie that plays safe with the status quo, even as it breaks with it.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Fly Me To The Moon,2024.0,"Romance,Comedy,Drama,History","Feel-good, witty, and heartfelt. I was surprised at how emotional it was to witness a universal achievement like the moon landing. Boomers are lucky. I doubt anyone younger than them will get to experience something like that again. Scarlett was fantastic. As was Woody. Channing was an awkward choice, but it worked out. Lots of big rocket launch shots. See it on the big screen.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
IF,2024.0,"Animation, comedy, drama","My youngest daughter wanted to see this, it has Ryan Reynolds in it, so I thought ""what the heck"". Man I did not anticipate that I would be a bumbling crying mess at the end of this film.

I wouldn't say this is a kids film, it's more of a film for adults who still have that child still inside of them, but they lost their way when they grew up and became adults. This is a movie for the child inside all of us, that still has that glimmer of hope.

John Krasinski seems like a big child, and that's basically what he was playing in here. I don't mean that in a negative way, I find it very endearing because you don't see that a lot anymore in people.

I really liked seeing the imagination of the little girl in here, but as I stated this is a HEAVY movie, so some things kids may not enjoy in here. When we got out of the movie I asked my daughter ""did you like the movie?"" and she said ""yeah, it was funny and sad"". I would have to agree with her assessment.

I would say that if you have a child that has trouble concentrating or sitting still, then they will be miserable in this. This is definitely targeted more for adults.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Maharaja,2024.0,"action, drama, thriller","Maharaja is one of the finest films of recent times! After a long time such good cinema is made in India. We can consider this one of the cult classics of Indian Cinema! The performances are good the direction is good and the script is just mind blowing! You are hooked to the film throughout! The non linear story telling also makes this a superb watch! Vijay Sethupathi as always has not failed to impress the audience. The most surprising performance is of Mr. Anurag Kashyap, he was very good in the role. There is a point in the film where you feel you have lost hope but then again some twist comes and you are back to normal. Full marks to the director Nithilan Swaminathan for making such good film!!",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Bad Boys: Ride or Die,2024.0,"action, comedy","Bad Boys: Ride or Die continues the formula of the previous 3 films before it, but that's not a bad thing. The action is top notch, intense and over the top. The humor, while a bit goofier than normal, is still there and it pulls just enough emotional weight to keep you gripped. While some of the goofier parts don't work as well, the dynamic of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence together is still electric. If you are a fan of any of the Bad Boys films before now, we can't see why you wouldn't enjoy this installment.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Longlegs,2024.0,Horror/Mystery & Thriller,"Don’t waste your time, this movie is stupid. Spoiler: it’s about some weirdo with satanic rituals who kills families through evil dolls. No FBI mystery thriller tracking down serial killer, it’s just as dumb as I have described it. You will be bored and the movie is super slow, plus Hollywood is a bunch of Satan worshipping assholes, at the end of the movie the character cries out “hail Satan”, that’s how satanic the world has become. Skip skip skip!!!",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Oddity,2024.0,Horror/Mystery & Thriller,This is everything I want in a horror movie. It genuinely had me squirming in my seat and throwing popcorn at the screen (I cleaned it up). It felt really refreshing to be whole heartedly creeped out but also loving the good time it was giving. Its a great film to see with your sister if you have one that you feel connected to. The acting was superb and I will be telling all my friends to check this out because sadly its not getting as much attention as it should be. Just my opinion but in comparison... longlegs? who? Never heard of her! Go see Oddity!,{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Despicable Me 4,2024.0,Kids & Family/Comedy/Adventure/Animation,"The movie was okay, but it could of been a little better. Like it could of had Kevin, Stuart, and Bob from minions/minions rise of Grew. It was completely wasted and they could of play an important part in the movie. They could have been the mega minions, or at least the three minions that went with Grew's family. They got the villains from Minions and minions rise of Grew to appear, but no Bob Kevin or Stuart. Stuart could have been stuck in the vending machine, and Bob and Kevin would have fought with alongside Grew and his family. To me that was just a big waste of opportunity. Like Kevin and Margo, they could have had bonding time as older siblings and helped each other out. Stuart and Edith could mess around with everything and cause some trouble. Then Bob and Agnes could have bonded with their stuffed animals. But still I give the movie three and a half Stars",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Inside Out 2,2024.0,Kids & Family/Comedy/Adventure/Animation,It was very cleverly developed and used all of ones feelings and instincts. Great parallel with thoughts put to the back of your mind. Anxiety was spot on! When everything was spinning I told my granddaughter she was having a panic attack. Great movie for anyone majoring in psychology or sociology even communication all college level. Kids loved it!,{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Rookie,2018.0,"action, crime, drama","The Rookie is one of the better cop shows on tv right now. Nathan Fillion leads a really good cast who all do a good job making this a show worth watching. Anyone who's seen Fillion in a show knows he never disappoints. This show does good job balancing drama, action, suspense and humor. It also shows how tough it is to be a police officer both at work and at home. Some of the negative reviews are from people that don't like that they take real world problems of today and apply them to the show. Everyone knows there are a thousand police shows to choose from but if you're looking for an exciting and original show then give The Rookie a try.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,2024.0,"action, adventure, Sci-Fi","You want it or not, a comparation with the old movie is automatic. The first thing that comes to mind is that it kinda drags the story. It lacks the flow of the previous. The main villan is unconvincing and I found myself many times not understanging how to categorise him. Is evil without a clear motive, powerful without convincing greatness. You don't know if you want to love him or not.

The actions scenes are ok, but no moment where I would thing it's something epic worthy. At times almost too much of the same.

Maybe the main problem was the script, neglected in the face of the many action scenes paired with fancy camera movement. The plot was ok, but it lacked a smarter way of putting it on the screen.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Yellowstone,2018.0,"drama, western",Yellowstone has easily become one of my favorite shows on tv. It's now going on to season five and every season has been fantastic so far. Almost every episode of every season is excellent and moves the story forward. There are some slow parts and slow episodes but that's not a bad thing. There is plenty of action and drama to keep everyone satisfied. The cast is just about perfect as they all give incredible performances. The cinematography is as good as it gets on tv and shows just how beautiful Montana is. I am completely hooked on this show and one of the few shows I still watch live because I love it that much.,{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Hillbilly Elegy,2020.0,drama,"I thought this film was a great drama that uses flashbacks of the past to explain what's running through J.D.'s mind as he tries to navigate university and his moms constant drug addiction. The acting was powerful all the way through. It has gripping emotions from start to finish that shows how bad you have to work, and to want something, to succeed when all the cards are stacked against you. Some may find this to be a ""woe is me"" kind of story, but I think it showed the never quitting spirit that Southerners have. Honestly, it's better than the professional critic reviews that I've read.

Overall, I really enjoyed the film and the story behind it. That to say, I can't figure out why this film is getting low ratings, but I think it's worth the watch. Currently it's in select theatres until 24 November when it releases onto Netflix in Canada.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The King's Man,2021.0,"action, adventure, thriller","I was very impressed with Matthew Vaughn's directing and writing in the first two films, of whom Jane Goldman also shared the writing credits, but in this one she was absent, and wow what a difference it made. In the ridiculously unnecessarily long 131 min runtime, only 10 mins total had anything to do with the Kingsmen. The rest was a convoluted scattershot of unnecessary plots that seemed to be a bunch of short films thrown in a blender to come up with this nonsense. There were too many plot and technical issues, and scenes that will make you shake your head in disbelief of what you're seeing, and why. Even the entire villain portion was too short, lame, and lazily written and executed. There were so many long dragged out and unnecessary scenes, you can literally fast-forward to the end of the scene and miss nothing of relevance. Basically 90% of this film was all filler with very little substance - and that's as a stand-alone film; as a prequel, it's all filler with maybe 2-3 minutes of any ""Kingsmen"" relevance. It's really too bad, because the rest of the film - cinematography, choreography, performances etc were all very good. I gave the first two films 9's, and I'm struggling to even give my very generous 6/10 for this one. Please include Goldman in any future Kingsmen films; at least her vision was coherent, cohesive, and exciting.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Midsommar,2019.0,"drama, horror, history","Let me first say, this is not a ""bad"" movie. It utilizes creative camera work and cinematography to add to the narrative. But I personally still didn't like it. Its main goal in my opinion is to disturb the viewer as much as possible through the use of sound, gory visuals and the feeling of isolation and insanity. While I can see how this can speak to a certain audience, it didn't appeal to me and made me want to turn of the movie quite a few times. If you are into these kinds of films, definitely give this a try but if you, like me, enjoy being scared by a horror movie instead of weirded out and disturbed, this might not be for you.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Logan,2017.0,"action, drama, Sci-Fi","I don't know what everyone's seeing in this movie that makes them think its such a masterpiece. Everyone's giving it 9's and 10's, but I'd give it a 6-7 at best. A 10/10 should only be reserved for a film that is flawless in every way -- whether it be acting, directing, cinematography, story and everything in-between. For it to be perfect, the story has to be gripping throughout the 140 minute run time, and that's where I felt it was weakest. It's serviceable, but it isn't perfect. I have a feeling that the people who are giving this film perfect scores are doing so because its much grittier than any X-Men movie in the past. It's definitely savage with the violence, which was refreshing to me and I appreciated them going all-out with the hard R rating. It starts out freaking great when it's setting up the overall plot, but then it REALLLLY drags along for the 90+ minutes in the middle. During the second act, the story spent so much time focusing on little moments with minimal significance to the overall arc, that I found myself feeling really underwhelmed when the big emotional moments finally happened. Don't expect to be heavily invested in the villains either... they're given very little development on screen, and as soon as any meaningful dialogue starts happening to give the audience some exposition into what's been going on for the last 20+ years in this universe, it comes to an abrupt stop. If you're looking for action, you will be happy with the beginning and the end. Other than that, it's nothing more than a mediocre country western style ""road movie"" about Logan and the girl. I also left with more questions than I had going into it, which I'm assuming will be told through a new series of prequels. Overall, it was a so-so experience that wouldn't be getting such high scores if it weren't for the fact that it's an R-rated X-Men movie.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Where the Crawdads Sing,2022.0,"drama, mystery, romance","It has that same feeling to The Notebook, but not entirely. The story pace was nice and in some aspects were quite suspenseful. It had sad and (for people who hadn't watched it) discomforting scenes. There's physical violence -- a trigger warning for those who hadn't seen it. That it was heartbreaking to witness but necessary (for me). Romance and mystery would best fit this genre. I liked the arts, science, and nature in the aesthetic. The marsh set was pretty.

Then that ending. It all wrapped up to give into her solace. In the last bots I kept trying tp conclude who killed who. I thought I got it right, until the very end. A nice little plot twist that put me in moral dilemma. Quite a soft yet staggering dynamic, this movie was. I like it very much. 10 out of 10.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Gentlemen,2019.0,"action, crime ","It's Guy Ritchies Best since Snatch, it's where he is most playful and comfortable in a film genre he knows well. The Cast is perfectly picked, especially Hugh Grant giving a different but yet so funny performance. Sit back and enjoy 2 hours of a British crime drama, which doesn't take itself too serious If we hadn't had lock stock or snatch then this would possibly looked at in a more classic Ritchie film so don't expect it to be as great as those.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Hereditary,2018.0,"drama, horror, mystery","I was alone and browsing for a movie to watch. Stumbled across this one and set out to casually watch a basic scary movie, with no clue of what I was about to experience. I barely moved the entire movie, and sat in stunned silence for 20 minutes after the credits started rolling, and hardly slept that night. I was petrified.

The absolute commitment that Toni Collette gave to this role as Annie is beyond description. She grabbed me and held me, and I'm not being hyperbolic. She found the deepest pain and distress inside herself that I've ever seen portrayed on screen. Her beautiful FACE revealed ugly and tragic feelings that words could never. She played mental illness and pain as real and as raw as I've ever seen it. Ever.

Hereditary has officially surpassed The Shining and The Exorcist as MY scariest and most disturbing movie of all time. And it's not even close.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
A Quiet Place Part II,2020.0,"drama, horror, Sci-Fi","This one picks up where the first one ended. There is a small backstory about the first day the creatures landed on earth. Director John Krasinski builds suspense through pacing, a slow buildup to when someone, as careful as they are, inevitably makes a loud noise that unleashes the slaughter. Krasinski likes to use wide angle shots of people running for their lives as the monsters fly into the frame. Silence is followed by a cacophony of screams.

We see more of the creatures this time, a sort of reptilian extraterrestrial concoction. Newcomer Cillian Murphy plays a survivalist who has lost everything. But the strength of the first A Quiet Place, as with the sequel, are the emotional, powerful performances from Emily Blunt, and her onscreen children, played by Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe. Simmonds especially, blends courage and compassion, garnering our support, so that she becomes the hero.

The ending leaves the door open to a third installment.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Parasite,2019.0,"drama, thriller","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.

I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.

The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Talk to Me,2022.0,"horror, thriller","Its an overall good movie especially considering it is the first feature film attempt by the directors. But is far from perfect. The biggest (& possibly the only) flaw of the movie is its protaganist. She does not miss a single chance to act stupid & selfish and keeps getting everyone else into trouble. This makes watching the movie a frustrating experience at times. If there was a proper sensible character to counter her and was given as much screen time, movie would have been better. But on technical level, its a well made movie with nice effects, cinematography, acting & direction. In the end, if I was to rank this movie in comparison to other horror movies. I would rank it above any conjuring or insedious sequels but below movies like 'It Follows'.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Menu,2022.0,"comedy, horror, thriller","The mix between horror and satire seems undecided or bland, the backstory was lacking and the plot presents itself as something grander than it really is. The same hollowness of the dishes carries onto the essence of the movie. Satirizing something that is hollow and giving the final product value is a difficult task, this movie really tries to do that, but given its nature, it didn't quite stick the landing with me.

The cast is simply great, full of recognizable faces and good acting. The cinematography was good, nothing out of this world but enjoyable.

Overall its entertaining, but the delivery of its message is not strong. Even if this flavor of satire wasn't the best suited for me, it kept me intrigued and while not fully satisfied, I enjoyed it.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Get Out,2017.0,"horror, mystery, thriller","Satire doesn't get much darker than this, a perspective derived from the opposite of bliss, the frictions and prejudice society draws, to control and manipulate, exploit and ignore.

What would you do, if someone took control of you, could control you're every move, set the tempo to your groove, had the first and final say, how you went about your day, chose the things that you would do, when and where, with what, with who. If you tried to make a stand, put a halt or raise a hand, the mighty structures that surround, would envelop and impound, one for all and all for one, will ensure you'll soon be gone, but be under little doubt, that you're never getting out.

An outstanding piece of cinema and satirical observation with added barbs.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Avengers: Endgame,2019.0,"action, adventure, drama",After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story. I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War. I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others. The story is average at best with big flaws.,{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Spider-Man: No Way Home,2021.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","My expectations for this film were off the chart due to what I had heard and read about how great it is. What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.

There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.

It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Everything Everywhere All at Once,2022.0,"action, adventure, comedy","If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this.

Free Guy,2021.0,"action, adventure, comedy","I entered the movie expecting to laugh out loud, and I did. Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi are comedic geniuses. What I didn't expect is the great chemistry between Ryan and Jodie Comer. Their relationship carried the movie.

Also, the trailer and the first act made us believe that it's the generic ""we live in a simulation"" movie like many others. But, as we progress, the movie becomes its own thing. And it's fantastic.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Blade Runner 2049,2017.0,"action, drama, mystery","It's very rare when a modern sequel/reboot is equal to the original in terms of quality, but this movie is that rare one. It carries over the sweeping and hypnotizing cinematography, it continues the storyline in a natural way, it references the original, but doesn't rip it off, it introduces new concepts without ruining the continuity, it expands on the themes presented in the original in a very natural way, it doesn't drag nearly as much as said original and it's got a more compelling protagonist. I have a feeling I'll just enjoy this movie more and more as time goes by, and I already love it a lot. It's a movie with a lot to unpack, and I have no doubt it will improve even more on rewatches.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
It,2017.0,"fantasy, horror","While it could have used more subtlety in the scare moments, the movie delivers surprising and effectively bizarre set pieces to keep you engaged. The likable and endearing losers group make the film worth watching again long after the fright has worn off. It manages to go from terrifying to hilarious, with Richie smashing it as the comedian of the group. It also touches on deeper themes of the bonds of friendship, the traumas that take our innocence away and the courage we need to face our fears. You won't only be scared, you'll be moved and inspired.

Joker,2019.0,"crime, drama, thriller","I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Avatar: The Way of Water,2022.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","The movie while not fantastic storywise was very enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.

You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all.

Green Book,2018.0,"biography, comedy, drama",A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way.

The Greatest Showman,2017.0,"biography, drama, musical","To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.

Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.

When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Knives Out,2019.0,"comedy, crime, drama","No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Godzilla vs. Kong,2021.0,"action, sci-fi, thriller","Rating basically for the epic battles in this movie, great special effects that blend perfectly with the environment accompanied by immersive sounds to rumble your speakers. Kudos to all those responsible for that. On the other hand, this movie does a poor job of character personalization and story plot. Had a lot of fake smiles and poor dialogues, did a poor job of making you feel for any character's situation and wanting more from them, it's like the movie pauses when scenes switch from the Kaijus to humans. Characters were introduced for no particular purpose or reason. Story was dull and uninspiring. Wouldn't recommend this movie for the plot or character performances but will recommend it for the epic Kaiju battles and CGI.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Ghostbusters: Afterlife,2021.0,"adventure, comedy, fantasy","I absolutely loved this Ghostbusters definitely better than 2016 mess! This has everything you'd want in the series with comedy, amazing cinematography, great story I even went with a friend and he noticed a few plot holes I didn't even realize it had some; I think everything was the way it should be. So much exciting bits that are feel good and has the perfect amount of surprises. I'm glad I got to see the advanced screening and I really hope the film gets the recognition it deserves!",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Minions: The Rise of Gru,2022.0,"animation, adventure, comedy ","Minions: The Rise of Gru' follows 11 3/4 year old Gru (voiced by Steve Carrell) trying to make a name for himself and join the ranks of an elite villians group, the Vicious 6. With humble beginnings as a troublemaker in his mother's basement, the minions (voiced by Pierre Coffin) are determined to help him succeed in his mission.

The film is a sort of origin story for Gru, despite having elusions to his childhood in the 1st and 3rd movies. The wacky and wonderful minions carry the film, but sadly, the plot seems haphazard. The henchmen, Jean-Clawed (voice by Jean-Claude Van Damme), Svengeance (voiced by Dolph Lundgren), and Stronghold (voiced by Danny Trejo) all seem to be second-string compared to Belle Bottom (voiced by Taraji P. Henson) and Wild Knuckles (voiced by Alan Arkin). The animation is fairly standard of the earlier movies, the flow is solid, and the film's ending kind of makes sense, but the plot in general is a bit of a hodgepodge.

The Suicide Squad,2021.0,"action, adventure, comedy","I honestly don't get why they keep trying to force suicide squad to work in film form when it just doesn't translate well to screen. Gunn tries his same GOTG style with the DCU and while visually and stylistically it's an objectively fun film to watch, the comedic overtones never land well. I may even prefer Ayer's brand of humor and even that wasn't even serviceable for the most part. The cast has such a weird dynamic and once again Margot Robbie is scathingly annoying but a bit more tolerable . Joel Kinnaman and Idris Elba are the standouts without question but they feel way too above the rest aside from Cena at times which can be unexpectedly brilliant in parts. The action is pretty well sequenced and delivered but as I said earlier the CGI can get down right bombarding in its delivery. The brutality is highly welcome however and satisfies unlike any DC film does in that aspect. And probably the most predictable yet ridiculous thing about the film is the audacious soundtrack choices. Sure you can play a novelty song during a specific scene to throw off tonal perspective but at this point it's just cliché. Overall I'd have to say it's a zany and enjoyable film but an overall scattered re-attempt to adapt a great comic.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Wonder Woman,2017.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","I must be honest, it took me a while before I finally decided to watch this, as I'm not a big Hollywood superhero movie fan. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story. It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitable.

As for the plot, I enjoyed the way the Amazonian women's back story was told, as well as Diana's (Wonder Woman). The visuals and photography are incredible! This is a visual spectacle. I loved the humorist dialogue, which was genuinely funny and never over the top or slapstick. Gil Gadot is just fabulous.

This superhero movie had a very realistic feel to it with the added bonus of feeling and emotion. There are so many truths in this film humanity should take note of. The film has a very unexpected ending compared to most superhero movies, and that's what I honestly loved about the film.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Jurassic World: Dominion,2022.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi","Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Fifty Shades Freed,2018.0,"drama, mystery, romance","If I could give a 0/10 rating I would. Christian's character has nothing interesting left to offer. Anastasia was scripted to seem like she is taking initiative (somewhat) and defying christian but her acting is clumsy and she does an awful job at coming across as even slightly empowered. The only good acting in the entire film comes from the banker. The plot is lazily thrown together and the attempts at suspense are god awful. The only people who will enjoy or defend this movie are absolute die hard fans. If you consider yourself a movie buff or even just someone who casually enjoys movies, DO NOT SEE THIS. I will spare you the frustration. I even enjoy bad movies, I love having fun with a bad movie and making jokes about it to my friends while we watch it. I did that in this film but even that was not enough to make this an enjoyable experience. The ""BDSM"" in this film is a sad sad portrayal that only the oldest, driest, and most sexually frustrated wine moms will find arousing. A TSA pat-down is kinkier than this excuse for erotica. The sex scenes feel very required and obtuse. The ending is a horrible attempt to tie things up and make them feel complete, it is incredibly cheesy, as is every single bit of dialogue in this film. I can't even continue to review this because if I do I will need to down a bottle of excedrin. Just don't waste your money.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Call Me by Your Name,2017.0,"drama, romance","Beauty in the midst of all the ugliness we're living in, it's like a shock. I wept like I hadn't wept in a movie since I was very young. It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in ""My Beautiful Launderette"" An explosion of beauty when you least expected.

Little Women,2019.0,"drama, romance","I read through many of the reviews for this 2019 version of ""Little Women"" and noticed that most reviewers adored the film. Because of this, I assumed I also would love the movie. Sadly, however, I was left feeling ambivalent about it...and I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter felt pretty much the same way.

I won't talk about the plot...after all, there's a summary on IMDB and lots of reviews talk about this. What I should mention is that the film is much more like the book than previous versions....a plus. But the reasons I still did not love this film are what stop me from recommending the film. First, there simply is too much story to cram into a little over two hours. If you are going to try to stick closer to the book, then perhaps consider making it a mini-series. This is because although the film is more like the book, to do this they also omit a lot of things....making the story seem a bit disjoint and confusing. Second, I really didn't think they did a good job of helping the viewers to actually care about the characters. Some of this was because the little women in the story were poorly chosen--much too old in some cases (the 12 year-old early in the story looked to be about 20). Some was because the choppiness of the story really harmed the film because the characters just seemed one-dimensional. Overall, a decent story but even with its sticking closer to the book, I much preferred the 1990s version...which was much more charming, fun and likable.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Little Things,2021.0,"crime, drama, mystery","A movie can leave feeling any number of ways-happy, sad, amazed, provoked, whatever-but the common denominator of good ones is that when the lights go up, you feel satisfied; it was worth the trip. I didn't fee that way when this one ended. Yes, it made its point: a detective working a murder case can become obsessed; it's the burden of responsibility, seeking justice, retribution, vengeance-choose your word-for the victim. And the point of the story is the old proverb: ""Before you set out on a journey of revenge, dig two graves"" (or something like that). That's all well and good, but IMO, this story melted away in the last 30 minutes. With some hard work on the script and more inventiveness, it could have been so much more.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Thor: Love and Thunder,2022.0,"action, adventure, comedy","Wow as a HUGE! Marvel fan I'm shocked at how bad this was. So many cliché jokes, no character development, and Chris Hemsworth is no longer an actor in my opinion but a Disney prop just generating revenue with the same old schtick. I personally think Disney buys reviews because how these disasters just debut with higher rating and falter when us fans speak our mind is shocking. Only good thing was I was able to go see Back Phone after 80 mins of this crap and actually found a movie I really enjoyed that I normally wouldn't have seen. Way better filmmaking and acting. The jokes in this Thor aren't even funny, it's like they try to get the audience to laugh with them but we end up laughing at them. Films don't care about good storytelling anymore, they want to be ""politically correct"" and enlighten us with how they want us to think. All hogwash. Save your money.

Don't Look Up,2021.0,"comedy, drama, sci-fi","A movie that about shows what would happen and how humanity would react if a huge meteor was threatening to destroy the Earth and humanity (the comedy aside). Both a funny but also tragic movie towards the end. It hits deeper considering how realistic this was (taking away the small unrealistic parts). I enjoyed this but in my personal opinion, they could've removed the comedy and just made it full on drama and it would've hit much harder than it did with the comedy.

The cast was great and the plot was intriguing. I, like many, do not get the hate for this movie at all. I personally think it was enjoyable. But I guess everyone just has their own opinions at the end of the day and that's fair but i would've rated it higher if they removed the comedy completely.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Crazy Rich Asians,2018.0,"comedy, drama, romance","Director Jon Chu was brilliant in Now You See Me 2, so naturally Crazy Rich Asians was a must see for me. What surprised me the most about the film was the phenomenal, and fairly untapped, acting talent from the entire cast. Constance Wu was absolutely perfect. It was difficult to praise any one performance besides hers because everyone was so genuinely great. I believe this speaks on the state of Hollywood and portraying Asians in primary roles. So many Asians actors and actresses are limited to supporting roles, so I hope that the break out cast of Crazy Rich Asians shows future movie makers that there is unbelievable untapped potential in the acting market. As the credits were rolling, I found myself feeling so happy and I could not quite put a finger on what was making me feel this way. Upon reflection, I believe that a well written, well directed, and well casted film is just bound to leave the viewer in some sort of awe. Crazy Rich Asians did just that.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}

Fifty Shades Darker,2017.0,"drama, mystery, romance","Neither as good or as bad as so many commentators seem to think. It has high production values. The direction is unobtrusive. I haven't read the novels, so cannot really comment on the source material. Dakota Johnson hit the corruptible ingenue character pretty well, and looks smashing while doing so. Jamie Dornan, though... In my comments on the first movie, I compared his depth of emotion to a terminator. In this one, he at least attempts some emotional scenes. He doesn't do them very well, but he tries. Supporting cast, especially Marcia Gay Harden, were pretty good, with the exception of Kim Basinger. There is really no reason to see this, except as a continuation of the first movie.

One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.

I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.

I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge,2017.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","This is a step in the right direction for the franchise after the letdown of Pirates 4. Johnny Depp doesn't bring his A game here but the other characters get some decent screen time so it doesn't take too much of the shine from the movie.

There are a few laughs and the usual bevy of action you'd expect. The plot is as farcical as ever, so don't expect a deep thinker - just enjoy the fun. Geoffrey Rush as Hector Barbosa never disappoints and Javier Bardem delivers a decent villain in the form of Captain Salazar.

Don't take it too serious, switch off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is: an action packed swashbuckling adventure.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Black Widow,2021.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi","Yes, the movie is an average film. But I enjoyed it because finally, I get to see where Black Widow came from. It's nice to see some of what made her, her. It is a shame that they didn't get more into it. I think the movie really could have given us more about the ruthless training and experiences that Widow had to endure. A lot of the movie was implied but not shown.

The plot was simple. It was nice to have some new heroes and villains. I really liked the cast and the jokes were fun. But as I said before the plot is very simple. Pretty much about killing a guy, a guy that we really didn't know or have any bad feelings for because we barely even got to see the man being evil. The movie lacked on showing the power of the widows. They had very spaced out and very few scenes of them.

I did enjoy the sister dynamic of the two girls. It was fun to see them both in action and it was fun to see them bicker with each other. In a way it is a sad movie. With what happened in the previous film. Did it do the Black Widow Justice? Some. It really could have been better by showing more. It missed all the heart string moments. Giving us more of an eye candy film with not much depth.

No Time to Die,2021.0,"action, adventure, thriller","Undoubtedly intended as a homage to the Bond franchise. Entertaining overall, but agree with other reviewers that it felt more like a typical and cliched action movie, particularly in the second half - more of a parody than a homage. Above all, while it's reasonable to modernise the Bond character, we may have now reached a point of no return for the spirit of Fleming's real Bond.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018.0,"animation, action, adventure","The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes. Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have? Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect.

Terminator: Dark Fate,2019.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi",In its core its a rehash of everything we have seen before only worse. As many said before some characters are almost a parody of their former selfs. The writers wanted to mess with the viewers expectations. So they also included a couple of surprises that no one asked for. They even succeeded in gender swapping a key character which happens a lot in movies theses days. And of course lots of stupid jokes. The action seems to be all CGI so nothing really exiting happening. I hope they won't do another one.

Andy Samberg shows that he's more than just a goofball, and Cristin Milioti proves, once again, why she should have had a more prominent role on How I Met Your Mother.

These changes completely ruined the smooth structure of the book to ""simplify"" it for modern audiences I suppose but again, WHY? The book is not that difficult to follow. Another thing that ruined the movie is the horrendous CGI. The CGI looks like a cutscene from a Playstation 3 game. The green screen OMG looks like someone cutout the character from a green screen with his phone and then pasted on a badly drawn background. And lastly the acting. I'm sorry but most of the cast were bad, which is sad because most of them proved their talent in other projects (except Gal Gadot. All she has is a beautiful smile) Skip this movie.

It truly believes it's deeper than it is, but left me unfulfilled. Kind of lazy/rushed writing in my opinion. Kind of just throws a bunch of mediocre stuff at you without any real substance and expects the audience to give it purpose and deeper meaning in there own heads.

The Lighthouse,2019.0,"drama, fantasy, horror","""The Lighthouse"" is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Describing it or even knowing whether or not I liked it is pretty difficult. Suffice to say, it was is a very, very unique movie...one that is quite haunting and difficult.

The story is set in the late 19th century and a lighthouse keeper (Willem Dafoe) and his assistant (Rob Pattinson) arrive at the facility for their tour of duty. At first, things seem pretty mundane, though over time they both seem to be losing their minds...Pattinson's character in particular. Where it goes from there is ugly, disturbing and weird.

This is definitely NOT a film for everyone. In fact, I'd go so far as to say most people probably would not like the film....and fewer yet would really enjoy it. But it also is a wholly original viewing experience and I can respect the folks who made it. The acting is good....and it feels much like peeking inside the mind of a madman.

Eternals,2021.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Alita: Battle Angel,2019.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi","It remains, for me, a mystery the source of seduction of this film. Sure, the story, the fights, the determination and vulnerability of the lead character. But it is more. Something becoming, scene by scene, the answer to deep expectations of the viewer. The story is simple and many pieces of it are so familiar. But it remains, from the beginning to the last scene, just fascinating. No explanations. Only a great and solid show.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Shazam!,2019.0,"action, adventure, comedy","It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Bohemian Rhapsody,2018.0,"biography, drama, music","This movie was a brilliant portrayal of the mixed up life, and massive talent that was Mercury ... and that is in no way meant to diminish the other fabulous musicians who made up this wonderful band. Whilst Freddie's life and death are quite well documented, his inner turmoil is not - this movie opens this up for all to see, and highlights actions and individuals who had a large influence on his fragile life, both good and horrendously bad. If only he could have been happy with the knowledge that he had one of the best singing voices, if not THE best, that ever fronted a rock band. Rami Malek does a wonderful job of portraying him, and in so many ways has captured his mannerisms to a tee. Loved it, and listening to the music in an IMAX auditorium was brilliant.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Nobody,2021.0,"action, crime, drama","I was intrigued by this movie as Bob Odenkirk was in the lead role in the movie. Since the scriptwriter and producers of this movie are also in the team of the John Wick series, I was expecting this kind of movie. First of all, the movie is great. The acting is great, the action is very good, the director did a great job too. This is one of the surprise movies of the year. It was fun movie.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Red Notice,2021.0,"action comedy, thriller","Red Notice is an interesting experiment to see what happens when you put three attractive and charismatic lead actors in a movie with a cookie-cutter plot. As it turns out, it's pretty enjoyable. And while the twists and turns don't really make sense, I still found myself smirking at the jokes and allowing ridiculousness because I was having a good time. Red Notice doesn't break any new ground, but it's a safe bet if you're looking for an action comedy to pass the time.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Prey,2022.0,"action, adventure, horror","Confession: I'm the guy who watched the original Predator way too many times thanks to the magic of VHS...but then never watched a single sequel afterwards. As far as I'm concerned ""Predator"" = jungles and body butter. So I fully admit that I have limited context here. That said, this movie kicked butt. I cared way more about Naru and her brother (not to mention her dog) than I did about anybody in the original. I found the cinematagrophy breathtaking, I found the characters compelling, and I'm kind of all in on seeing what happens when we transport modern franchises into different historical/cultural contexts. Plus, the callbacks were delightful. Nobody's going to give this movie an Oscar, but I'd rather watch a story like this than most movies with capes and poorly staged action sequences. I was sucked in from moment one, and Amber Midthunder completely captivated me for the whole runtime. It's nice to know that movies like this can still surprise me, not to mention make me stand up and cheer.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Beauty and the Beast,2017.0,"adventure, family, fantasy","As an unabashed fan of the 1991 film, I came to this version ready for a fight -- more than one! Who dares tamper with a classic? But bit by bit, and moment by moment, I was enchanted all over again: the human performances ""fleshed out"" the old animated ones; the coggier Cogsworth and more limited Lumiere charmed me afresh with their differences from memory. The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and I never felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, the sum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a fresh masterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much much more than a ""cover"" -- if Disney can do this as well with its other planned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in. This is a brilliantly-crafted film that honors and yet moves beyond its beloved original.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Whale,2022.0,drama,Brendan Fraser has proved he still has it. It's a beautiful performance that's long overdue for him. A film that will make you cry and love Brendan. A must see. He has long been a fan favorite actor but this Blast from the Past will make you rethink his acting. A brilliant film that is a sneaky great film. If you are on the fence about seeing this you'll regret not seeing it. I felt a sense of sadness and love when watching this film and I cried many times. It's not a film that comes around 9ften but when it does it changes cinema. An Oscar contender film with real heart. The best film of 2022.,{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Irishman,2019.0,"biography, crime, drama","Amazing acting, great story lines and some twists. Loved how the story was told through the eyes of De Niro's character as he was at the end of his life.

For anyone that likes gangster movies, it is worth a watch - high quality actors from across the great gangster films. The only negative is that it lasts 3.5 hours. This would put me off watching it again soon, but definitely worth seeing for the first time.

Kept me glued throughout - defo give it a watch. You won't be disappointed.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Spider-Man: Homecoming,2017.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi","If you are a true fan of spider-man, this movie isn't for you but if you can keep an open mind you might actually enjoy it. It's predictable, like most super heroes movies, it's not a great movie but it's a good one! Even though Tom Holland performs a teenager that talks to much I kind of enjoy his performance. I would say it's a movie to watch when you want something light with a little bit of action.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Thor: Ragnarok,2017.0,"action, adventure, comedy","The action and humor mixed up in this movie was done with such quality that you forget about the problems with it, if there are even any at all!

Zack Snyder's Justice League,2021.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","As a life long comic fan, DC characters are more close to my heart than Marvel characters. The first making of this film was just disappointing. It seems like there are bunch of idiots sitting on the WB executive positions who have no vision at all. The first film was literally incomplete. This one tells the full story and I must say nicely. This is the movie we, all the fans wanted and deserve.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Bones and All,2022.0,"drama, horror, romance","Two birds of a feather with a common appetite, living in the shadows with a curse they try to fight, struggle to give in, to temptations that spellbind, an addiction of the mind that leaves them hamstrung and confined; finding others with dependencies more practiced and distilled, whose lives have little meaning, all alone and unfulfilled, helpless and exposed by the hand they've all been played, the promised life and expectations, all diminished and betrayed.

Some great performances but all eclipsed by Taylor Russell who is outstanding as the conflicted Maren struggling to come to terms with who she is and what she can and cannot do about it.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,2019.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","I can't call this movie good. I yawned my way through the first half and when it finally started telling a story in the second half, I hated the story they told. I shouldn't be surprised from what they did in the previous movies though.

I just wish they respected the history of the movies and didn't try so hard to outdo everything that came before.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Anna,2019.0,"action, thriller","Well, I don't get all those harsh critics about the lack of realism, for example regarding the fight scenes, I mean, common, of course a killing machine like Anna is an impossibilty, but does anyone complain about the killing capacities of guys like James Bond, John McClane or John Wick!? Those movies any more realistic!? Anna is simple a nice entertaining action flick with some good fights, a beautiful and well performing actress, but for certain one of the more conventional and simpler movies made by Mr. Besson. All in all a good movie with some twists and fun moments but no masterpiece.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Father,2020.0,"drama, mystery ","It's just so sad and also a bit terrifying. My wife works as a nurse in an alzheimer's ward, and she said this is the most realistic depiction of the disease she has ever seen.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2022.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Hamilton,2020.0,"biography, drama, history","I started watching this out of curiosity and to say I have seen it, being the cultural touchstone that it is. At first, I was a little detached, not liking the songs too much, and thinking I would probably just skip through to end in a minute. I couldn't stop watching and it really sucked me in. I have to say, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it at all, live in the theater. I benefited greatly from the captions and the ability to put it on pause to consult Wikipedia from time to time. The lyrics were so clever and really told the story. I ended up very moved and almost cheering at the end. Of course, now that I am familiar with the story, I would love to see it live and would enjoy it immensely. But I would strongly recommend this for a first time viewing. I will definitely re-watch. And probably again and again.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Jumanji: The Next Level,2019.0,"action, adventure, comedy",I absolutely loved the first instalment and to a large extent those that enjoyed the first will enjoy this it's still entertaining fast paced and humerous. The only thing I found was rather than laughing out loud and being on the edge of my seat like the first I had the occasional chuckle sat back. Having said that laughing out loud or not I was never bored and still had a smile on my face for the majority of the film. A decent sequel exiting at in interesting point for a potential 3rd movie.,{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,2021.0,"action, adventure, fantasy","This was just a lot of fun. The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better. I think that, all in all, this is probably the best thing Marvel has produced since Endgame.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Venom,2018.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi","Venom is about the symbiotic relationship of man and alien, with the latter being the gross one. Funny at times, with a lovely performance from Tom Hardy -if you are a fan of mr Hardy, this is going to be entertaining for you. First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch. It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention. I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd. So, all in all its def not the best action film of all times or even of 2018...but dont have too high expectations and you will definitely like it. 8/10.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Encanto,2021.0,"animation, comedy, family","Encanto is a creative movie featuring beautiful and vibrant animation. However, the story feels a little underdeveloped. While there are some magical and emotional moments, it seems as if they didn't know how to end the movie. The lack of a strong villain also makes this movie a little less compelling. Nevertheless, the music is fun, and we enjoyed watching Encanto together as a family.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Black Panther,2018.0,"action, adventure, sci-fi","Although this is a really good movie, it has amazing costumes, they really got the essence of a African cultures, the cast, in general, did a good job, it still had some problems, including, special effects, character development, wasting such an actor as forest Whitaker and a really common narrative superheroe story. In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.

In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
amma Mia: Here We Go Again!,2018.0,"comedy, musical, romance","In a world that has gone crazy, it was so nice just to sit back for 114 minutes and forget about real life. Transport yourself back to a simpler time and of course to the wonderful music of ABBA. Throughout the movie you go through all the emotions yet once it had finished you just want to sit there and wish you could do it all again The whole cast looked like they had as much fun making it as we did watching it. Everyone did their bit although Lily James was outstanding as the young Donna. It's one of those rare films as you leave your seat and enter the real world you do so with the biggest smiles of your face.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
The Incredibles 2,2018.0,"animation, action, adventure","Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.

Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.

I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
Aladdin,2019.0,"adventure, comedy, family","Having not previously seen the Disney-animated version of Aladdin-just choice clips usually featuring the Robin Williams-voiced Genie-I do understand this Disney-live-action version is mostly the same sequence of events with the same songs with one addition. So on that note, I very much enjoyed this with my movie theatre-working friend. Will Smith is amusing enough as the Genie now and when the more dramatic scenes come, I was touched enough by the story, characters, and the actors playing them. And those songs are, of course, as awesome as ever! So on that note, I recommend this version of Aladdin.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
It: Chapter Two,2019.0,"drama, fantasy, horror","Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.

The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average ""fast-food"" horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.

The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
John Wick: Chapter 2,2017.0,"action, crime, thriller","I really loved the first movie, although I feel that this one missed the mark slightly.

Firstly, the storyline was less clear this time round, so I wasn't fully on board with John's motive and what was driving him. I felt less invested in him going out and beating everyone up (Whereas in the first movie I was really rooting for him).

There were also a lot of parts that were illogical, and I often found myself questioning why someone did X when it would have been easier for them to do Y. It happened enough times for it to ruin the storyline for me.

I think it was an okay movie, with some great scenes. But as a whole, it didn't come together for me and I was pretty bored.",{'error': '500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.zerogpt.com/api/detect/detectText'}
